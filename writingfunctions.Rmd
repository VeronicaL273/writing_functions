```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(25, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```


```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){.  #add additional
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  
  if(length(x)<5){
    stop("you need at least 5 numbers to compute z score")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

does it always work?
No, but we add some "if"s to control the properties of x_vec that go into the function

```{r}

```
